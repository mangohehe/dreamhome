# DreamHome Project

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Node.js:** (Mention the Node.js version or LTS version you recommend. E.g., "Node.js v16 or LTS version" or "Node.js v18 or higher") You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). (If you used nvm, you can add something like: "It is recommended to use Node Version Manager (nvm) to manage Node.js versions. See the nvm documentation for installation instructions: [https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)")
* **npm (Node Package Manager):** npm is usually installed with Node.js. You can check the version with `npm -v`.
* **Parcel:** (Specify the version if you have a strong preference. E.g., "Parcel v2") Install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g parcel

(If you are using yarn, replace the npm install commands with the yarn equivalent. e.g., `yarn global add parcel`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mangohehe/dreamhome.git
cd dreamHome
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

(or `yarn install` if you are using Yarn). This will install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server (which will watch for file changes and automatically reload the browser), run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will typically start the development server on `http://localhost:<port>` (the port will usually be shown in the terminal).

## Building the Project

To create a production-ready build of your application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` (or `build`) directory containing the optimized files for your application. You can then deploy the contents of this directory to your web server.
